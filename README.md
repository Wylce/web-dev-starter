## Overview

This is the first lab for CS 408, intended as a simple exercise to help us
get used to the basic development processes we'll be using for the rest of the
class. It includes a single webpage defined by the index.html file, with style
rules defined in a style.css file and basic button functionality defined in the
main.js javascript file.

## Running

For full functionality, you can run this website by opening the index.html file
from a locally hosted web server. 

## User Guide

Click on the "Say Hello o/" button to see a friendly alert popup that says "hello o/".
